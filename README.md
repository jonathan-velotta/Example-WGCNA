# Example-WGCNA
This is example code for using WGCNA to identify co-expression networks
It is based off of study assessing adrenal tissue expression variation between two genotypes and expression correlation with a single variable, heart rate. The code enables the user to build a newtork in WGCNA (including identifying the beta value), identify modules, correlate module expression to heart rate, and test for differences in module expression between gentoypes using rank-transformed ANOVA.
